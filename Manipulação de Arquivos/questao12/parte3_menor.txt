So where is the Great Filter?

Behind us, or not behind us? If the Great Filter is ahead of us, we have still to confront it
If it is true that almost all intelligent species go extinct before they master the technology for space colonization, then we must expect that our own species, too, will go extinct before reaching technological maturity, since we have no reason to think that we will be any luckier than most other species at our stage of development
If the Great Filter is ahead of us, we must relinquish all hope of ever colonizing the galaxy; and we must fear that our adventure will end soon, or at any rate, prematurely
Therefore, we better hope that the Great Filter is behind us


What has all this got to do with finding life on Mars? Consider the implications of discovering that life had evolved independently on Mars (or some other planet in our solar system)
That discovery would suggest that the emergence of life is not a very improbable event
If it happened independently twice here in our own back yard, it must surely have happened millions times across the galaxy
This would mean that the Great Filter is less likely to occur in the early life of planets and is therefore more likely still to come


If we discovered some very simple life forms on Mars in its soil or under the ice at the polar caps, it would show that the Great Filter must exist somewhere after that period in evolution
This would be disturbing, but we might still hope that the Great Filter was located in our past
If we discovered a more advanced life‐form, such as some kind of multi‐cellular organism, that would eliminate a much larger stretch of potential locations where the Great Filter could be
The effect would be to shift the probability more strongly to the hypothesis that the Great Filter is ahead of us, not behind us
And if we discovered the fossils of some very complex life form, such as of some vertebrate‐like creature, we would have to conclude that the probability is very great that the bulk of the Great Filter is ahead of us
Such a discovery would be a crushing blow
It would be by far the worst news ever printed on a newspaper cover


Yet most people reading the about the discovery would be thrilled
They would not understand the implications
If the Great Filter is not behind us, it is ahead of us


So this is why I’m hoping that our space probes will discover dead rocks and lifeless sands on Mars, on Jupiter’s moon Europa, and everywhere else our astronomers look
It would keep alive the hope for a great future for humanity


Now, it might be thought an amazing coincidence if Earth were the only planet in the galaxy on which intelligent life evolved
If it happened here – the one planet we have studied closely – surely one would expect it to have happened on a lot of other planets in the galaxy also, which we have not yet had the chance to examine? This objection, however, rests on a fallacy: It overlooks what is known as an “observation selection effect
” Whether intelligent life is common or rare, every observer is guaranteed to find themselves originating from a place where intelligent life did, indeed, arise
Since only the successes give rise to observers who can wonder about their existence, it would be a mistake to regard our planet as a randomly‐selected sample from all planets
(It would be closer to the mark to regard our planet as though it were a random sample from the subset of planets that did engender intelligent life: this being a crude formulation of one of the sane elements extractable from the motley ore of ideas referred to as the “anthropic principle”
)

Since this point confuses many, it is worth expounding it slightly
Consider two different hypotheses
One says that the evolution of intelligent life is fairly easy and happens on a significant fraction of all suitable planets
The other hypothesis says that the evolution of intelligent life is extremely difficult and happens perhaps only on one out of a million billions planets
To evaluate their plausibility in light of your evidence, you must ask yourself, “What do these hypotheses predict that I should observe?” If you think about it, it is clear that both hypotheses predict that you should observe that your civilization originated in places where intelligent life evolved
All observers will observe precisely that, whether the evolution of intelligent life happened on a large or a small fraction of all planets
An observation selection effect guarantees that whatever planet we call “ours” was a success story
And as long as the total number of planets in the universe is large enough to compensate for the low probability of any given one of them giving rise to intelligent life, it is not a surprise that a few success stories exist


If – as I hope is the case – we are the only intelligent species that has ever evolved in our galaxy, and perhaps in the entire observable universe, it does not follow that our survival is not in danger
Nothing in the above reasoning precludes the Great Filter from being located both behind us and ahead of us
It might both be extremely improbable that intelligent life should arise on any given planet, and very improbable that intelligent life, once evolved, should succeed in becoming advanced enough to colonize space


But we would have some grounds for hope that all or most of the Great Filter is in our past if Mars is indeed found to be barren
In that case, we may have a significant chance of one day growing into something almost unimaginably greater than we are today


In this scenario, the entire history of humankind to date is a mere instant compared to the eons of history that lie still before us
All the triumphs and tribulations of the millions of peoples the have walked the Earth since the ancient civilization of Mesopotamia would be like mere birth pangs in the delivery of a kind of life that hasn’t really begun yet
For surely it would be the height of naiveté to think that with the transformative technologies already in sight – genetics, nanotechnology and so on – and with thousands of millennia still ahead of us to perfect and apply these technologies and others that we haven’t yet conceived of, human nature and the human condition will remain unchanged for all future
Instead, if we survive and prosper, we will presumably develop into some kind of posthuman existence


So this is why I conclude that the silence of the night sky is golden, and why, in the search for extraterrestrial life, no news is good news
It promises a potentially great future for humanity


None of this means that we ought to cancel our plans to have a closer look at Mars
If the red planet ever harbored life, we might as well find out about it
It might be bad news, but it would tell us something about our place in the universe, our future technological prospects, the existential risks confronting us, the possibilities for human transformation: issues of considerable importance


It is impossible to know in advance what insights might be gleaned by applying the kind of careful and systematic study to such big questions that we apply every day to smaller and less consequential technological and scientific problems
There may be surprising arguments and ideas out there merely waiting to be discovered
Some of these might even turn out to have practical ramifications of such importance as to change our whole scheme of priorities
Perhaps the greatest benefit from the SETI program will result if it prompts thinking about these larger matters


Theoretically, smart ambitious scholars could start thinking without waiting for such prompts
Expensive instruments, however, have a way of lending scientific status and respectability to a field of inquiry
Academics are keen to put as much distance as possible between themselves and the kooks and cranks that flock to these big questions
If large telescopes, NASA satellites, and complicated mathematical data analysis are involved, it becomes harder for outside observers to mistake the work for the ramblings of UFO‐nuts and other crackpots
There may be no signals from space, yet those with their antennas tuned to more anthropomorphic wavelengths are sure to pick up a buzz of social signaling in people’s attitudes towards the search for extraterrestrial beings
Such social background noise might in fact be one of the main obstacles to intellectual progress on many big picture topics
